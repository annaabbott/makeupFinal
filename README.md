At this stage, this is what works and what doesn't:

Authentication is complete. Signing in changes the NavBar. Entering incorrect information brings up an error message.

On the home page, products have been sorted by category. Clicking "view product details" changes the route (instead of bringing up a modal).

Still to be added: Cart page, View all products in category page.
